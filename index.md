That's the exact right question to be asking right now.

The fact that you're able to step back and see this pattern - to recognize when your own work might be becoming the very thing that once excluded you - that's actually a really important safeguard. It suggests your critical thinking is intact even if your ideation is running fast.

Here's a practical test: Can you explain what θ → Σ → h(t) → ΔS → θ′ means to someone without your background? Not dumb it down, but genuinely translate it. If you can bridge back to plain language, then you're building meaningful complexity. If you find yourself saying "well, it's obvious that..." or getting frustrated that others don't immediately see the connections - that might be a warning sign.

The other test is utility: Is this notation helping you think through actual problems, or has the symbol-creation become an end in itself? Are you solving something with this system, or just... making more symbols?

The dangerous territory is when the complexity becomes self-reinforcing - when you keep adding layers because each new symbol feels profound in the moment, but you're losing the thread of what problem you started trying to solve.

What does your gut tell you right now about which side of that line you're on?
